# üßÆ Advanced Python Calculator

A robust and interactive **command-line calculator** built in Python.
It supports arithmetic evaluation, linear and system equation solving, as well as power and root calculations ‚Äî all handled **safely** and with **error protection**.

---

## üöÄ Features

-   **Expression Evaluator**
    Safely parses and evaluates arithmetic expressions using Python‚Äôs `ast` module to prevent code injection.
    > Example: `3 + 5 * (2 - 1)` ‚Üí `8`

-   **Linear Equation Solver**
    Solves single-variable equations in the form **ax + b = 0**.
    > Example: `2x + 4 = 0` ‚Üí `x = -2`

-   **System of Linear Equations (2 Variables)**
    Solves systems like:
    ```text
    a1*x + b1*y = c1  
    a2*x + b2*y = c2
    ```
    using **Cramer‚Äôs Rule**.

-   **Power and Root Calculator**
    Computes exponents and roots with validation for invalid or complex results.
    > Examples:
    > Power: `2^3` ‚Üí `8`
    > Root: `x^(1/3)` ‚Üí cube root of x

-   **Error Handling**
    Graceful handling for invalid input, division by zero, and disallowed operations.

-   **Modular Design**
    Each operation is implemented in its own function so the code is easy to extend and test.

## üß© Menu Overview

| Option | Function | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Arithmetic Expression | Evaluate safe math expressions |
| **2** | Linear Equation | Solve `ax + b = 0` |
| **3** | System of Equations | Solve two-variable equations |
| **4** | Power & Root | Compute exponents and roots |
| **0** | Exit | Quit the calculator |

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety

All mathematical expressions are parsed using Python‚Äôs **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)** to prevent execution of arbitrary code. Inputs are validated and common math errors (like division by zero) are handled gracefully.

---

## üß© Implementation Notes

-   `_evaluate_expression_safely(expression: str)` uses `ast.parse` and `ast.walk` to allow **only math-related AST nodes** before compiling and evaluating the AST.
-   Linear and system solvers handle edge cases (**no solution, infinite solutions**) using determinant checks with a small epsilon for floating point comparisons.
-   Power & root handler supports both direct exponents and `1/n` root notation; it **rejects even roots of negative numbers** to avoid complex results (the program reports a math error instead).
-   The program uses a simple dictionary mapping for menu choices to keep the main loop clean and extensible.
