# About — Logic Garden

> *“A small garden where ideas grow, not in beauty, but in logic.”*

## 🌱 Concept
**Logic Garden** is a long-term project that collects small, independent code experiments and logic snippets in multiple programming languages.  

Each script stands alone — there is no requirement for interconnection. Every file is a **seed of logic**, designed to capture an idea, test a concept, or explore freely.

The goal is **not to build a full system**, but to:
- **Grow small ideas** into unique logic patterns  
- **Record thought processes** in code, not just words  
- **Preserve experiments** that may one day contribute to something larger  

## 🔹 Philosophy
- **Minimalism in logic** — one idea per file, simple and focused  
- **Code independence** — no file is required to depend on another  
- **Evolution without a fixed direction** — allow logic to develop naturally  
- **Cross-language experimentation** — Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and more  
- **Documentation as reflection** — notes about the thought process, not just technical details  

## 💡 Writing Principles
1. **One idea per file** — e.g., `emotion_logic.py` should only implement logic for emotions  
2. **Brief description at the top** — explain the idea, purpose, and what is being tested  
3. **No need for perfection** — raw experiments are welcome  
4. **Preserve old experiments** — all versions document the evolution of thought  
5. **Use `docs/` for reflections and indexes**, not just technical documentation

## 🔭 Long-Term Goals
Logic Garden is designed to **grow indefinitely**, without a fixed endpoint. Potential directions include:  
- Becoming a **personal logic library** with unique utilities  
- Serving as a **playground** for game systems, AI, or virtual world experiments  
- Acting as an **archive of thought** on how logic can represent human reasoning
